## About me

I'm very much a straight to the point kind of guy. I either get things done or figure out a better way of achieving the goal. I thrive when given real problems to solve and the freedom to implement solutions. Though quite demanding of fellow collegues I make friends easily as I am open and can communicate my ideas clearly.

## My Top 5 Strengths

*Backed up by [StrengthsFinder 2.0](http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-20.aspx)*

1. Learner: Great desire to understand and improve things with powerful focus. Will move on after subject is clear.
1. Individualization: I'm intruiged by what makes each person special.
1. Activator: Idea to action can be extremely quick. I'm also impatient when things don't happen.
1. Self-Assurance: I feel confident in managing my own life and work methods. Corporate rules make me less productive.
1. Command: Indecisiveness is the devil. I take control and lead as the situation requires it.
