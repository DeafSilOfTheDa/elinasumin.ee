## My Top 5 Strengths

*Backed up by [StrengthsFinder 2.0](http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-20.aspx)*

1. Learner: Great desire to understand and improve things with powerful focus. Will move on after subject is clear.
1. Individualization: I'm intruiged by what makes each person special.

# Career

## Overview

When 3D animation didn't satisfy my entrepeneurial fascination, I started to learn programming online. My third project got funded, but ended up flunking anyway. Since then I've worked at large companies and small startups, anything that provides a proper challenge. I love going on out my comfort zone and learning about various aspects of any project - not just software.

## Technologies

**Most commonly used**
- Node.js, Meteor.js, React.js
- Linux, Bash, Nginx
- MongoDB, SQL

**Have used, but a lot less**
- PHP, Python, Java
- Docker
