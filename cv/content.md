## Overview

When 3D animation didn't satisfy my entrepeneurial fascination, I started to learn programming online. My third project got funded, but ended up flunking anyway. Since then I've worked at large companies and small startups, anything that provides a proper challenge. I love going on out my comfort zone and learning about various aspects of any project - not just software.

## My Top 5 Strengths

*Backed up by [StrengthsFinder 2.0](http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-20.aspx)*

1. Learner: Great desire to understand and improve things with powerful focus. Will move on after subject is clear.
1. Individualization: I'm intruiged by what makes each person special.
1. Activator: Idea to action can be extremely quick. I'm also impatient when things don't happen.
1. Self-Assurance: I feel confident in managing my own life and work methods. Corporate rules make me less productive.
1. Command: Indecisiveness is the devil. I take control and lead as the situation requires it.
