	<h2>Krister's Startup School</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>The MUST READ books are a summary of The Lean Startup, a summary of 4 Hour Work Week and The Personal MBA. The only actual book you need is Running Lean. In fact go buy that now and only then go read get the summaries.</li>
		<li><b>Do not build your product yet!</b> Go talk to your customer one-on-one first. Get 10 of them to give you money. If it's emails you're collecting you need at least 100x more.</li>
