	<h2>Question-Question-boolean</h2>
	<p>If you're having trouble getting anywhere with conversations consider playing this game.</p>
	<h3>The only rule</h3>
	<p>You can only ask a question or answer with "true", "false" or "good question".</p>
	<h3>Some guidelines</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Asking yourself is a low way to go.</li>
		<li>If there are multiple parts to your question (switch case) then it counts as one question and the answering side can only reply with one of the 3 answers.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>We assume we know our conversation partners context - the world they live in. So I'd go as far as to say 80% of conversations basically always miss the point. So instead of constantly telling people stuff they don't care about this game puts you in a position where you need to understand your partner down to the detail with precise questions and true-false answers. Get to the bottom of what you guys are actually talking about and don't agree to disagree.</p>
