	<h2>Krister's Startup School</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>The MUST READ books are a summary of The Lean Startup, a summary of 4 Hour Work Week and The Personal MBA. The only actual book you need is Running Lean. In fact go buy that now and only then go read get the summaries.</li>
		<li><b>Do not build your product yet! Go talk to your customer one-on-one first. Get 10 of them to give you money. If it's emails you're collecting you need at least 100x more.</b> If you know exactly what the product will look like you've already gone too far. Perhaps you're imagining your app being used by thousands of people? It's such a large cake and all I want is a small piece - can't be that hard, right? The only real important thing is how do you get the first 100 people to actively use your product once it reaches the MVP stage. This means focusing hard on only one super specific solution and getting that to work. "The platform is so powerful there are so many ways to make this work" doesn't cut it. Hearing a starting entrapeneur say this makes me cringe, because I thought like that once and it's just not how things work. You'll likely spend two months building something and abandoning it not because the project isn't interesting, but that nobody is using it.</li>
		<li>In fact <b>don't start developing your actual product until you've got a client waiting at your door</b>. Any entrapeneur will have dozens of ideas floating around their head at any time. The only real way to choose your next project is by validating all of them (read Running Lean). The validation phase is ripe when the money is so close you can smell it.</li>
