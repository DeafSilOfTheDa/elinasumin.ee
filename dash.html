        # Hey there Dash team!

        Why Dash? It's the only project with clear goals that I agree with and a proper team working on getting there. 

        ## Experience

        - 6 years a full-stack developer
        - 6 years of working with or starting Startups (also in CTO role)
        - 6 years of both PostgreSQL and MongoDB with a bit of Redis.
        - 6 years of using git and hosting repositories (including hosting custom bare bones server for student exams)
        - 5 years of Bash (using Arch Linux)
        - 4 years of JavaScript backend (2y with Meteor.js and 2y with Node.js)
        - 4 years of DevOps (most of my servers are self-hosted)
        - 3 years of teaching programming to beginners
        - 3 years of React.js
        - 2 years of using Docker for production deployments
        - Years of UX designing as most projects lack these skills (thus adding to the programmer workload)
        - 1 year of webdevelopment for cryptocurrencies.
            - [Dashcentral for Helium](https://github.com/KristerV/heliumpay-budgetweb-deploy)
            - [Proof of Existence platform for Crown](https://timestamp.busyman.cz/)
            - As a personal side project I'm building a git comparison tool to see who forked from who. Seen too many Dash clones claiming to be original.

        ## Qualifications

        The Experience section will answer most of the qualifications, but I'd like to point out a few things I don't have:

        - Testing and CI systems experience. While I did write some tests for Dash just to figure out how it works [and not embarrass myself a second time](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/pre-proposal-add-automated-tests-to-dashs-code-closed.21652/#post-155640) I don't have real world experience with TDD or similar.
        - Experience in p2p tech
        - I've got a BSc, but in computer animation (first contact with programming, but not thorough)
