## About me

I'm very much a straight to the point kind of guy. I either get things done or figure out a better way of achieving the goal. I thrive when given real problems to solve and the freedom to implement solutions. Though quite demanding of fellow collegues I make friends easily as I am open and can communicate my ideas clearly.

1. Individualization: I'm intruiged by what makes each person special.
