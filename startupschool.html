	<h1>Krister's Startup School</h1>
	<h3>Idea</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Your idea sucks. Ask around.</li>
		<li>Keeping your idea to yourself keeps you blind. Take off your blinders. If someone is going to copy your idea, good for you - it was going to be copied anyway you saved yourself some time.</li>
		<li>Your idea has been thought of thousands of times around the world. Hundreds have attempted to execute it. Find out why others failed, learn from their mistakes. Talk to failed entrapeneurs.</li>
		<li>Always put your idea into a form like The Lean Canvas to understand the business side.</li>
		<li>Every idea is always good with a million people using it. Question is how to get the first 1000 users.</li>
		<li>How good your idea is can be measured in how painful it is to people and how willing are they to pay you for a solution.</li>
		<li>What the solution is doesn't even matter before you've validate that the problem is indeed worth fixing in the first place.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Pre-Execution</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The MUST READ books are a <b>The Lean Startup</b>, <b>4 Hour Work Week</b>, <b>The Personal MBA</b> and <b>Running Lean</b>. If you're only going to read one get Running Lean. In fact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172" targer="_blank">order it right now</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sobxOzRjAGg" target="_blank">watch the summaries</a> of the other ones while you wait for it to arrive.</li>
		<li>Also read what seems interesting in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Grahams Essays</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Do not build your product yet! Go talk to your customer one-on-one first. Get 10 of them to give you money. If it's emails you're collecting you need at least 100x more.</b> If you know exactly what the product will look like you've already gone too far. Perhaps you're imagining your app being used by thousands of people? It's such a large cake and all I want is a small piece - can't be that hard, right? The only real important thing is how do you get the first 100 people to actively use your product once it reaches the MVP stage. This means focusing hard on only one super specific solution and getting that to work. "The platform is so powerful there are so many ways to make this work" doesn't cut it. Hearing a starting entrapeneur say this makes me cringe, because I thought like that once and it's just not how things work. You'll likely spend two months building something and abandoning it not because the project isn't interesting, but that nobody is using it.</li>
		<li>In fact <b>don't start coding until a client is trying to pay you</b>. Any entrapeneur will have dozens of ideas floating around their head at any time. The only real way to choose your next project is by validating all of them (read Running Lean). The validation phase is ripe when there is money on the table.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Execution</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Don't think of a solution, think of all the solutions and a way to measure which pieces actually work.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Team building principles</h3>
	<p><i>Disclaimer: Most of these ideas are not tested. Each team is different. Take with a bucket of salt.</i></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Each member is as valuable as their colleagues say they are. With the exeption of the idea author, who is 1% more important than everyone else.</li>
		<li>All disputes should be handled by the people themselves according to what best serves the goal. If in doubt, measure.</li>
		<li>Dividing the ownership should happen when there is money coming in or company being founded (which should also happen as late as possible). You'll never know who will stay or how much someone will put in effort before actually building the company. Some members will leave and some may be wished away. A smaller team with confusing ownership is better than a large "i want my piece" way of thinking team.</li>
		<li>Any member may bring in a new member for a tryout with the hope of becoming a partner after evaluation. The team is the decidor.</li>
		<li>Any member may work towards the goal how they wish and not follow anyone's elses wishes. However make sure you keep your team up-to-date.</li>
		<li>Profit are divided amongst all members regardless of ownership.</li>
		<li>All members have a say in all decisions.</li>
		<li>Team members should not have titles or roles, but areas of responsibility (AoR).</li>
		<li>AoR can be changed by self-initiation. One can't just ditch current responsibilities, but moving into a new field should be easy.</li>
		<li>All numbers are public between members. Including the most sensitive of them all - ownership, salaries and other benefits. Ideally these documents are Pull Request ready.</li>
